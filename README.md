# Virtual-Homelab
This project incorporates the use of Oracle VM VirtualBox to create an Active Directory environment. The project consists of the creation of a Windows Server 2019 machine which is turned into an Active Directory Domain Controller. Next, the network was configured and a Windows 10 Client machine was connected to the domain. A PowerShell script was also used to generate 100 user accounts. 

**Stage 1:** The first steps involved downloading Oracle VM VirtualBox which will create the Virtual environment to create the Windows Server and Windows 10 machines. After this, I created the Windows Server machine and set up the network adapters. 1 adapter will be used to connect the Windows Server machine to the internet, whilst a 2nd one will be dedicated for the internal network.
